 Required collections: 
    lysseus/utils

 Main module: memory.rkt

 This game uses Racket 2htdp/image and 2htdp/universe and is mouse event-driven.

 Use the mouse pointer to slect a tile and turn it with a click. Then move to another tile and click it to match pairs of images. If the images match the tiles remain locked in place showing the images. If not the images are once more hidden and a new selection pairing continues. The game ends when all the pairs have been uncovered.
